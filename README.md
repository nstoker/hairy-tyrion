A learning project for the Juce Framework to track the scores earned on the Rocksmith and Rocksmith 2014 games.

The Rocksmith games are aimed at helping you to learn to play the guitar or bass.

The games show the notes that you have to play, and a special adaptor allows the game to detect the notes you have played. 
The more you get right, the higher your score. Very simple. Great fun. Very frustrating at times.
